## python_scripts
This readme file is created to explain the Python scripts used in this project.
### prom_to_opa.py
This script queries CPU metrics from Prometheus and sends them to OPA and prints back the adaptive decisions.

### node_failure_prom_to_opa.yaml
This script is created to check the node failure condition; as of now, I created it as a separate file for testing. We can merge it with the main file later.
